      <p>I'm currently self-teaching myself to eventually become a web developer, starting from the ground up.
      <br>I began my journey on May 14, 2019.
      <br>Currently working on HTML5 and CSS3 to just learn the basics of layouts, styles, and how websites work.
      <br>Next step is to become a JavaScript ninja!
      <br> Looking forward to working together.
