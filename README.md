# hello-world
Hello world, I am David Weinstein.
I'm currently self-teaching myself to eventually become a web developer, starting from the ground up.
I began my journey on May 14, 2019.
Currently working on HTML5 and CSS3 to just learn the basics of layouts, styles, and how websites work.
Next step is to become a JavaScript ninja!
Looking forward to working together.
